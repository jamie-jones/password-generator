# Password Generator

## Description

Need a new password? You got it! On this page, you can get a new password generated for you with just a click of a button! In this password generator, you will find a simple "Generate Password" button that, when clicked on, will bring up a prompt to pick the length of your password, with number restrictions. If you pick too little amount, or too many numbers, it will return you to the prompt to re-pick your password length. Once you do so, it will ask you if you'd like to include, lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. You can decide not to include some and include others, but you MUST include AT LEAST ONE. In the end, the password will be generated using the randomizing generator and VOILA! There you have it! Your new password!!

When coding this password generator, I got a better understanding of how to use For Loops as well as If/Else statements. Not only that, but I understand functions completely now, which was something I had difficulty understanding until now.

## Credits

A special thank you goes out to the tutor that helped me understand and format this password generator.

Another thank you goes out to my fellow Coding Bootcamp students, who sat on voice call together as we put our heads together and worked hard to figure out what goes where and why.
